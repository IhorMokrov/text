Works really well most of the time
*% kk K& & Mar 25 - YoFacexD

The app alongside the printer works
tremendously. The printer for me a 9125e
has yet to have any issues. The only issue |
have come across is the app. In short the
app will recognize that | am connected to
my printer and will simply say that
functions like scanning are unavailable. But
itis a very quick fix, annoying but quick at
least. When this error occurs | simply close
the app down and restart it with success.
Hopefully a fix comes soon as again more
annoying than anything else.

Received my new printer on time was so
pleased at how easy it was to use the
quick set up paperwork that came and
being able to use my phone and the app to
do everything | need to do. | got the
special offer of three months of ink
cartridges, which | thought was great so
don't have to worry about that for a while.
Very happy with my printer and would be
more than happy to recommend to anyone
that wants a quick and easy to set up and
use printer for the home.

Ink delivery

* kk KK Mar 31-NCThomas

I've been using HP’s automatic Ink delivery
for several years and it's wonderful to
know that no matter how often | go to use
my HP printer there is always enough ink
to get even the largest of my print jobs
done without having to think about running
to the store to replace expensive ink
cartridges. The HP print / scan /fax
software manages everything | need and
on more than one occasion saved me from
running out to find someone to send a fax
before midnight.

Best Bang For Your Buck

Kk kkKw Mar 25- Daysha A.

This printer does far more than what |
originally thought. | believe | bought the
printer for maybe no more than $65 after
tax. |am able to print, scan and upload ,
mobile fax, print direct from my phone, set
up subscriptions to have ink and paper
delivered to my door for $7/month. The
abilities are endless. This printer is saving
me a lot of time and money by doing
everything from the comfort of my own
home. #AllSmiles :)

Every few years a new printer comes out. It
is as if the wireless aspect of it has an
expiration date that when the printer
reaches it , will no longer connect. In this
day and age, it makes the printer a big
expensive paper weight. The printers, now
will only work through your phone. |

easy to connect and less complicated.

Terrible experience with HP printers.

Printer troubleshooting options are
difficult to find

KKK Mar 5 - Readandfixthis

It took me way too long to find how to
clean the inkheads in the app. The settings
are buried within an option that is not
intuitive. There are 2-3 settings options
and it's not in any of them. It’s hidden in
the image of the printer with no indication
that section is clickable. Pretty frustrating
to try to access.

The main thing is to PRINT

and go to print. | cannot the printer shows
up, but when | select it, it does not “take”.
After a lot of time on fully updated and
current iPhone | figured out that HP is
driving traffic to their application instead of
making it easy to print. | had to save the
PDF as afile, then use the HP app to
upload the file in order for it to print. So
stupid. Never buying an HP again, and |
bought HP for decades.

have had to reconnect to the network
multiple times and each time it takes

to my printer because the HP Smart app

troubleshooting) it prints nicely. HP ink is a
complete scam. Paid for it for also 3 years

Buy your own ink from wherever you feel
Comfortable and print as you see fit.

Also it should be mentioned, with
subscription you only can print so many
pages a month from the printer you own or
get charged additionally per page but if
your print comes out incorrect or with
errors those printer based mistakes count
against your pages per month. If you do
subscribe you cannot use a cash app card

Clunky app and scolding customers

This app is not very user friendly. | only use
my printer every few weeks. Every time |

passwords and/or reconnect the device to
my network. That's a hassle, and should be
better, but it’s not notably worse than any

awful is that after going through this
rigmarole one day, out of the blue | get an
email scolding me for using “unofficial” ink
cartridges and informing me that my
“benefits” (some of the printer's features)
have been permanently revoked. While |
think the idea that using “unofficial” ink is
a punishable transgression is ridiculous,
the ironic thing Is that I've only ever
bought official HP ink. | didn’t get this
message after changing cartridges, | got it
after going through the tiresome ritual of
re-establishing the WiFi connection. So the
irony is that HP going out of their way to
try to harass me for not purchasing their
ink (which I've always done) has resulted in
me ending my practice of not only
purchasing their ink but also any other HP
product ever again. Nice job!

*& & & & & Nov 6 - HHBennett

HP Smart App is a textbook example of
corporate greed disguised as convenience.
Imagine buying a printer and paying full
price for it, only to be held hostage by an
app that refuses to let you use your printer
unless you fork over even more money for
a subscription. That's right—you buy the
printer, pay for the toner cartridges, and
still they want more.

I'm shocked HP would stoop so low,
resorting to shady, manipulative practices
like this. They're taking advantage of their
own customers, knowing that many will
feel cornered into paying. This paywall on
top of owning the device and its supplies is
highway robbery. It's a scam that preys on
people just trying to print a few documents
at home.

If you're thinking about buying an HP
printer, think twice—you're not just buying
a printer; you're buying into a predatory,
nickel-and-dime business model that
treats customers like cash machines.

HP not so smart
*& & & & & Jan 4-GBC957

| have had an OfficeJet Pro 8600 for years
and used it without difficulty with various
MAC products, utilizing the HP utility and
MAC's built in drivers. Then | bought the
HP 9130e and installed this software. It
doesn’t work, it doesn't work, it doesn’t
work. It reminds me of Charles Dickens’
Office of Circumlocution where they
master the art of how not to do it. This is
how not to do it. The main task for these
printers is to let you print something with
ease from an ipad, iPhone, or some other
tablet device. This is how not to do that.
You must first go around to all your
devices and install this software. Then you
watch as it fails to communicate with
anything, without given you any notice as
to why. | am off to Epson or Canon where
hopefully | can find a better product.

wants every penny from customers.
Instead of providing me a subscription to
order ink monthly. They can deem the ink
cartridges un usable and there for you
can't print anything. Basically, the
subscription is for you to use the printer,
and not for the ink cartridges. Huge scam

| use to really enjoy my HP printers. That is
why | got another one. This one is a smart
printer. My mistake because this allows HP
to control when | can print.

| got the printer with three months of free
ink. At the end of the three months, HP
disabled my printer until | let them know if |
would be purchasing ink from them or else
where. Because ya'll disabled my printer |
chose to go elsewhere.. Then | was
informed that | had 7 free printing days
from the ink | received from HP. Then it
would be cut off no matter how much ink is
left. Then the trouble really began.

| had problems printing anything. Had
problems connecting to the WiFi and other
stuff that made it frustrating for me to
print.

Now | have my own ink. HP should have no
reason to monitor my home printing or my
ability to print. This is not information you
need for anything.

| would not recommend HO printers to
anyone due to the company's control issue
over it printers that the consumer pay for.

proprietary that it is difficult to print from
